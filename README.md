A simple self-learning bot. Implementation of a Retrieval based chatbot based on Python's NLTK library (Natural Language ToolKit).

According to Medium (https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-a-simple-chatbot-in-python-using-nltk-7c8c8215ac6e):
The Self learning bots use some Machine Learning-based approaches and are definitely more efficient than rule-based bots. Two types: Retrieval Based or Generative

In retrieval-based models, a chatbot uses some heuristic to select a response from a library of predefined responses. The chatbot uses the message and context of conversation for selecting the best response from a predefined list of bot messages. The context can include a current position in the dialog tree, all previous messages in the conversation, previously saved variables (e.g. username). Heuristics for selecting a response can be engineered in many different ways, from rule-based if-else conditional logic to machine learning classifiers.

NLTK is required to make programs understand and work with human language.
